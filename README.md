# Environment Sensor Workshop for Children - Part 1

This is an introduction to enviroment sensors to teenagers. This is aimed to provide a sense of what is chaging around them that constitutes environment and how it can be measured. The measurement is a DIY (Do It Yourself) project involving Arduino Uno, Sensors and basic programming. This is suitable for any teenager with adult supervision. We have two leves of it. This is the introductory part or part 1. In this workshop participants will learn

1. Enviornmental parameters and why/how to measure
2. Introduce to basic electronics.
3. Introduce to Arduino Uno	
4. Introduce one of the sensors
5. Introduce display
6. Program Arduino
7. Sharing Program and Data

** If you are below 18. Adult supervision is a must. Please be with your guardian or parent to recive the kit.**

## A bill of materials
1. Arduino Uno R3 Compatible Development Board ATmega328P - 1
2. USB cable for Arduino Uno R3 - 1
3. AC to USB power (Same as the ones used by android phones) - 1 
4. DHT22 / AM2302 Digital Temperature and Humidity Sensor - 1
5. LCD 6x2 LCD display display for arduino,8051,AVR,PIC,ARM  - 1
6. Breadboard - 1
7. Breadboard Wires (M2M, M2F) - 15 each 
8. Regular 1.5 Battery - 1
9. Led -1
10. 10K Potentiometer
11. A few resistors 10K, 1K, 230

## Common Items for the workshop
1. Multimeter 
2. Junction boxes
3. Laptop, 1 for every two kids
